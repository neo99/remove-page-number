# remove-page-number
This Python libary removes page number line from a text file that was converted from a HTML page. The assumption of this library is that a line contains page number only if that line has nothing but 0-9 number, not even comma or dot.

When you use "Read aloud" feature of MicroSoft Edge, it also reads the page number, which is often distracting.
